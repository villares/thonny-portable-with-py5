# Warning: Package manager search is broken on Thonny 4.1.6 and earlier due to changes in PyPI. Thonny 4.1.7 will fix it, I'll update my bundle soon!

## Bundles for Windows 64-bit

**Note:** Do not keep the Thonny portable folder in a path containing non-ASCII characters (i.e. `C:\\Users\alÃª\Thonny-416-portable\`). Unfortunately, the *jpype 1.5.1* release that should fix this issue doesn't seem to be working.
