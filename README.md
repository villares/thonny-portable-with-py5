## Thonny for Windows 64-bit

**Notes:** 

- The "Manage packages" and "Manage plug-ins" panels broke on Thonny 4.1.6 and earlier versions due to recent changes in Python's PyPI infrastructure, but now Thonny 4.1.7 fixes these issues.

- Do not keep the Thonny portable folder in a path containing non-ASCII characters (i.e. `C:\\Users\alÃª\Thonny-416-portable\`). Unfortunately, the *jpype 1.5.1* release that should fix this issue doesn't seem to be working.
